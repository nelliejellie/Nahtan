                    Friends and family go out on vacations all the time, 
                    it is fun and all, until everyone comes back home and remember ‚ÄúOh!!, 
                    I didn‚Äôt hit my bucket list‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh!!, we forgot to go to the hill of palmaris‚Äù etc. 
                    Some made plans that got forgotten, while enjoying the fun of the vacation and if 
                    the vacation is a one time thing, those plans wouldn‚Äôt be kicked off the bucket list people had for the vacation. 
                    Blist is a vacation bucket list application which is aimed at helping users plan 
                    for activities to be done during a vacation and help achieve their plans based on where and when they want it done.

                        After making  research and talking to friends that travel regularly, I found the reasons for this problem to be:
                        <ol className='list-decimal ml-4'>
                            <li> Users find it hard to keep trackmwith activities while on vacation.</li>
                            <li>Nothing to remind the user of that particular activity exist in a location the user is in.</li>
                            <li>Users wants to be able to plan and designate duties amongst friends going on a vacation with them.</li>
                            <li>Users wants to be able to save for a particular vacation alone or with friends.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </article>
                    <img src={require("../assets/img/image7.png")} alt="" className='w-[20%] h-[20%]' />
                </div>
            </div>
            <div className='flex flex-col space-y-8 w-[80%] mx-auto'>
                <div className='flex justify-between items-center'>
                    <article className='flex flex-col space-y-4 max-w-[60%]'>
                        <p className='text-[#6BA5FA] font-bold mb-8 text-2xl'>Goals</p>
                        From the problem statement, I came up with a digital solution, 
                        making an application that helps it‚Äôs users make a vacation bucket 
                        list that can be shared with friends and families going on the same 
                        trip so all can know the locations and activities to be done on the vacation, 
                        and also help with saving up for the vacation if that is required. 
                        The application will  help with management of the bucket list, 
                        notification of items left to be kicked off, location reminder to help kick off 
                        the item, timeline, wallet and other fun features.
